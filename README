sign in with twitter will no longer have access to your site until Twitter bring their OAuth support back online.

1. Go to Twitter and register your site to obtain a login key and secret
2. The call back URL you need is path-to-your-elgg/action/twitterlogin/return
3. Enable the plugin and you are ready to go
